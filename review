Things i liked
/////////////////////////////

1.The feature seems interesting that if a person likes the user then the user will have some limited time to start chatting and get connected.
2.The timing in the chat section seems good because it displays accurate time of a person's message.
3.The features are interesting and catchy.
4.The idea of adding an extra section about education,interests music,movies and tv series is good.
5.The feature of swiping left for profile and right for chat is good.
6.The user interface is pretty decent.
Things i didnt like
//////////////////////////

1.The chatting section is bit laggy.

2.Work should be done on the layout so that the user will be able to see his/her phone's title bar because a person cannot see the network or time or anything above the title bar so work should be done here for better convinence.

3.Another feature should be added where if we swipe downward it will show bio or little bit information about the user.
4.While adding institution name,movie,series,interests, etc it should show suggestions.
5.If we press back it get stuck to the loading screen showing Titanic only and then crashes.
6.If we upload an extra pic, it doesnt get uploaded.
7.There should be an option to delete the profile picture.
